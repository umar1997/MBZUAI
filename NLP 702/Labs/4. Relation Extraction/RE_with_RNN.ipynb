    "# Neural Relation Extraction with PyTorch\n",
    "\n",
    "Relation extraction is an information extraction task that aims to detect semantic relationships between pairs of entities in a given text. The entities can belong to different types (person, location, date...) and relationships can differ in nature (contains, belongs...). This task is essential for building knowledge graphs which are a graph structure representing the relationships between large numbers of entities. These graphs have wide applications such as search engines, recommendation systems and healthcare.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this post, we will demonstrate Neural Relation Extraction (NRE) using an LSTM-based neural network for a set of given sentences. We will use the data from the [SemEval-2010 Task 8](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QO_CnmvNRnYwNWu1-QCAeR5ToQYkXUqFeAJbdEhsq7w/preview). Each sample in this dataset is a sentence where the two entities in question are tagged. The semantic relationship with each sentence is provided. There are nine different kinds of relationships in this dataset in addition to the \"Other\" class which makes for ten total classes:\n",
    "1. Cause-Effect  \n",
    "2. Instrument-Agency\n",
    "3. Product-Producer\n",
    "4. Content-Container\n",
    "5. Entity-Origin\n",
    "6. Entity-Destination\n",
    "7. Component-Whole\n",
    "8. Member-Collection\n",
    "9. Message-Topic\n",
    "\n",
    "An example from this dataset is shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "*The \\<e1>factory\\</e1>'s products have included flower pots, Finnish rooster-whistles, pans, \\<e2>trays\\</e2> tea pots, ash trays and air moisturisers.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Product-Producer(e2,e1)*\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above, the two entities we are concerned about are marked with \\<e1> and \\<e2> tags and the corresponding relationship is provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many approaches for solving the relation extraction problem in NLP. In this post, we will test two bidirectional LSTM approaches. The first is a simple BiLSTM that takes as input the sentences as sequences of words. We learn word embeddings to use as input features for the LSTM. For the second approach, we build two word position vectors for each sentence indicating the relative distance of each word with respect to each entity. We also learn high dimensional embeddings for these relative positions and concatenate them to the word embeddings. Including word position vectors is a technique that has been shown to improve performance since otherwise the model would not know which are the entities in concern. This approach has been adopted in many research works such as [here](https://aclanthology.org/P16-1123/).\n",

    "## Data Preprocessing\n",
    "Before we dive into our NRE model, we must first load and preprocess the data to prepare it for our task.\n",

In this case, the number of elements to embed is set to the vocab size (including 0 and 1 tokens) since we need a unique embedding vector for each token in the vocabulary. We also set the argument *padding_idx* to 0 to indicate that tokens of ID 0 are meant for padding and can be ignored when learning the embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before passing the output of the embedding layer to the BiLSTM, we pass it through the \"pack_padded_sequence\" function. This function packs and batches the data in a way to ignore the zero indexes corresponding to the padding tokens. This results in a considerable computation reduction. To do this, we need to provide the actual length for each sequence (prior to padding). Based on this information, the function will basically sort the samples and divide them into batches based on actual length. For a full explanation of the workings of this function refer to the tutorial [here](https://github.com/sgrvinod/a-PyTorch-Tutorial-to-Sequence-Labeling).\n",

For our task, we only need the last hidden state to be fed into a dense softmax classification layer. The shape of the hidden state output is (2, batch_size, hidden_size) while a dense layer expects an input of shape (batch_size, input_size). The hidden state has an additional dimension of size 2 due to the presence of two LSTMs for our bidirectional model. We therefore reshape the hidden state by collapsing the additional dimension into the last dimension. As a result, the new hidden state shape would be (batch_size, hidden_size × 2).\n",

This is considering the extreme case when the we have the longest possible sentence and the entity is at the beginning/end of the sentence. Therefore the last/first word would have a distance equal to the maximum sentence length and this is the largest relative position we will have to embed.\n",

This model has clearly overfit the training data. Although the second model also presents a validation gap albeit smaller, there is an opportunity to stop at epoch 8 to eliminate this while the firts model starts to overfit much earlier.\n",

Both models often mistook relationships of type \"Other\" for actual relationships since the prediction are scattered and not concentrated on the diagonal element. This could be due to samples of type \"Other\" slightly invoking types of relationships that are present in the dataset."
