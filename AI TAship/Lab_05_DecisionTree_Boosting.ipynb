Decision Tree Algorithm\n","**Decision Tree (DT)** algorithm belongs to the family of supervised machine learning algorithms which can be used for both regression and classification tasks. This algorithm takes in data $(X\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n\\times d},$ where $n$ is the number of samples and $d$ is the number of features in each sample) and constructs a tree-structured classifier or regression model.\n","\n","Following are the main steps to construct a DT:  \n","**Step-1:** Begin the tree with the root node where entire dataset is considered.  \n","**Step-2:** Find the best attribute/feature in the dataset using Attribute Selection Measure (ASM) and declare this attribute as root node label.  \n","**Step-3:** Divide the dataset into subsets using conditions on the values of root node data. Each subset of data will become a child node.  \n","**Step-4:** At each child node, use ASM and further divide the dataset.  \n","**Step-5:** Recursively make new child nodes using the subsets of the dataset and  continue this process until a stage is reached where one cannot create the child node and call the final nodes as leaf nodes.\n","\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## 1.1 Dataset\n","We will use a toy dataset 'WEKA Weather Data' published by Fordham University for decision tree algorithm related tasks.

Information Gain Ratio (IGR) is a modification of Information Gain that reduces its bias and is usually the best option. It was introduced by [Ross Quinlan](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00116251) in 1986.  IGR overcomes the problem with information gain by taking into account the number of branches that would result before making the split. It corrects information gain by taking the intrinsic information of a split into account. Formal definition of Information Gain Ratio of an attribute $x_j$, denotes as $\\operatorname{IGR}(\\mathbf{p},x_j)$, is given below:\n","\n","$$\\operatorname{IGR}(\\mathbf{p},x_j) = \\frac{\\operatorname{IG}(\\mathbf{p},x_j)}{\\mathrm{SplitInfo}(x_j)},$$\n","\n","where $\\mathrm{SplitInfo}(x_j) = -\\sum_{v\\in vals(x_j)} \\times\\Pr(x_j=v) \\log_2(\\Pr(x_j=v))$. In other words, `SplitInfo`$(x_j)$ is actually the entropy of the categorical distribution of the values of $x_j$ attribute. An attribute which has more number of distinct values, will have large SplitInfo and it will reduce IGR of that attribute. Similar to IG, an attribute with higher value of IGR is selected for a particular decision node."],"metadata":{"id":"trZ79VyY4Az6"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["def get_split_info(df, attrib_name=None):\n","    attrib_unique_values , probs = get_attrib_distribution(df, attrib_name)\n","    split_info = get_entropy(probs)\n","    return split_info"],"metadata":{"id":"uLc1jOzE5Spx"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["split_info_outlook = get_split_info(df, attrib_name='outlook')\n","print(\"SplitInfo of 'outlook' =\" , split_info_outlook)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"mi2t1bAheKAF","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1664193190320,"user_tz":-240,"elapsed":7,"user":{"displayName":"Ex Why Zee XYZ","userId":"16700964037974729982"}},"outputId":"858643ac-7c81-48f2-80e4-961315da6574"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["SplitInfo of 'outlook' = 1.5774062828523454\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["<br><br>\n","**TO DO :** Find `SplitInfo` of `temperature` , `humidity` and `windy` attributes and comapre your values with the ones shown in the tables of [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_gain_ratio#Example) example. \n","<br><br>"],"metadata":{"id":"MOmFYVA9lfxe"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["split_info_outlook     = get_split_info(df, attrib_name=??)\n","split_info_temperature = get_split_info(df, attrib_name=??)\n","split_info_humidity    = get_split_info(df, attrib_name=??)\n","split_info_windy       = get_split_info(df, attrib_name=??)\n","\n","print(\"SplitInfo of 'outlook'     =\" , round(split_info_outlook,5))\n","print(\"SplitInfo of 'temperature' =\" , round(split_info_temperature,5))\n","print(\"SplitInfo of 'humidity'    =\" , round(split_info_humidity,5))\n","print(\"SplitInfo of 'windy'       =\" , round(split_info_windy,5))"],"metadata":{"id":"G3n6fAeGeXkB"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["def get_info_gain_ratio(df, attrib_name=None, class_attrib_name=None):\n","    info_gain = get_info_gain(df, attrib_name=attrib_name, class_attrib_name=class_attrib_name) # IG(p,x_j)  ,  get information gain of the given attribute\n","    split_info = get_split_info(df, attrib_name=attrib_name) # SplitInfo(x_j)  ,  get split information of the given attribute\n","    info_gain_ratio = info_gain/split_info # IGR(p,x_j) = IG(p,x_j)/SplitInfo(x_j)\n","    return info_gain_ratio\n"],"metadata":{"id":"hIY2FpSrctcI"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["info_gain_ratio_outlook = get_info_gain_ratio(df, attrib_name='outlook', class_attrib_name='play')\n","print(\"Infomration Gain Ratio of 'outlook' =\" , info_gain_ratio_outlook)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"7JDrtHNQd6Cm","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1664193200867,"user_tz":-240,"elapsed":6,"user":{"displayName":"Ex Why Zee XYZ","userId":"16700964037974729982"}},"outputId":"d9134603-46f7-4b5c-d51c-f07a9680d17b"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Infomration Gain Ratio of 'outlook' = 0.15642756242117514\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["<br><br>\n","**TO DO :** Find `Information Gain Ratio` of `temperature` , `humidity` and `windy` attributes and comapre your values with the ones shown in the tables of [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_gain_ratio#Example) example. \n","<br><br>\n","**Question:** According to `Information Gain Ratio` values of each attribute, which attribute should be selected for root node?  \n","**Answer:**\n","\n","<br><br>"],"metadata":{"id":"HNUa6nDclQWL"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["info_gain_ratio_outlook     = get_info_gain_ratio(df, attrib_name=??, class_attrib_name=??)\n","info_gain_ratio_temperature = get_info_gain_ratio(df, attrib_name=??, class_attrib_name=??)\n","info_gain_ratio_humidity    = get_info_gain_ratio(df, attrib_name=??, class_attrib_name=??)\n","info_gain_ratio_windy       = get_info_gain_ratio(df, attrib_name=??, class_attrib_name=??)\n","\n","print(\"Information Gain Ratio of 'outlook'     =\" , round(info_gain_ratio_outlook,5))\n","print(\"Information Gain Ratio of 'temperature' =\" , round(info_gain_ratio_temperature,5))\n","print(\"Information Gain Ratio of 'humidity'    =\" , round(info_gain_ratio_humidity,5))\n","print(\"Information Gain Ratio of 'windy'       =\" , round(info_gain_ratio_windy,5))"],"metadata":{"id":"LNT8dbm-lIqO"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### 1.2(d) : Gini Index $(\\mathrm{I_G})$\n","Gini Index of an attribute is a measure of **how often a randomly chosen element from the splitted dataset would be incorrectly labelled if it was randomly labeled according to the distribution of labels in the splitted dataset**.

AdaBoost\n","\n","As mentioned earlier, `AdaBoost` method falls in the category of boosting ensemble learning. The core principle of AdaBoost is to fit a sequence of weak learners (i.e., models that are only slightly better than random guessing, such as small decision trees) on repeatedly modified versions of the data. The predictions from all of them are then combined through a weighted majority vote (or sum) to produce the final prediction.  \n","\n","\n","The data modifications at each so-called *boosting* iteration consist of applying weights $w_1,w_2,\\ldots,w_n$  to each of the training samples. Initially, those weights are all set to $1/n$, so that the first step simply trains a weak learner on the original data. For each successive iteration, the sample weights are individually modified and the learning algorithm is reapplied to the re-weighted dataset. At a given step, those training examples that were incorrectly predicted by the boosted model induced at the previous step have their weights increased, whereas the weights are decreased for those that were predicted correctly. As iterations proceed, examples that are difficult to predict receive ever-increasing influence. Each subsequent weak learner is thereby forced to concentrate on the examples that are missed by the previous ones in the sequence."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"CQ6qqyVd6Mkp"},"outputs":[],"source":["from sklearn import datasets                          # to load datasets provided by
