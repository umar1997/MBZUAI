Please finish assignment 3 before November 30, 23:59PM. The instructions are as follows:
1. You can finish the assignment with your classmates together. The number of people in a group should be no more that 3 (i.e., <=3). Please submit your report before the deadline November 30, 23:59PM.
2. The task: Implement a neural network model for the task of dependency parsing.
3. You can implement any neural network models you want that are able to address the task.
4. You can use any dataset you like to train your neural network model. An example dataset that may be used for the task of dependency parsing: https://universaldependencies.org/#download
5. You can use any code/libraries/toolkits you like.

If you don’t remember what is dependency parsing, you could go to our slides downloadable from the lms website.

Dependency parsing is the task of extracting a dependency parse of a sentence that represents its grammatical structure and defines the relationships between “head” words and words, which modify those heads.
Example:


Relations among the words are illustrated above the sentence with directed, labeled arcs from heads to dependents (+ indicates the dependent).
